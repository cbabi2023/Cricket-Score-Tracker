- **Background Image:** The application enhances its visual appeal by incorporating a background image ('cric.png').

This Cricket Score Tracker is an introductory example that demonstrates how to create a simple GUI application and perform web scraping in Python. It serves as an educational tool for beginners, providing insights into the integration of GUI frameworks and web scraping techniques for real-time data retrieval.
